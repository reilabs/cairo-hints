```

The most important files are the `oracle.proto` file and the `oracle.cairo` file. The `oracle.proto` file is the protobuf file that will be used to generate the client and server code for the oracle. The `oracle.cairo` file is the Cairo file where the oracle proto structs and functions will be implemented by Cairo Hints.

The `.proto` file uses the `protobuf` syntax to define the messages and services that the oracle will use, you can find more information about the syntax [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3).

Let's see how it works.

### Message and server definition

The following is the `oracle.proto` file:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package oracle;

message Request {
    uint64 n = 1;
}

message Response {
    uint64 n = 1;
    string status = 2;
}

// We define the service by defining the response and request messages as well as the server
service SqrtOracle {
    rpc Sqrt(Request) returns (Response);
}
```

This file defines a `Request` message with a single field `n` of type `uint64`, a `Response` message with two fields `n` and `status` of type `uint64` and `string` respectively, and a `SqrtOracle` service with a single `Sqrt` rpc that takes a `Request` message and returns a `Response` message.

The request will be the struct that we will be using in cairo to reach the python server or the agents-api and the response is the information that we will be receiving from the server.

Also we can see that we have define a service called `SqrtOracle` with a single rpc called `Sqrt` that will be used to get the square root of a number. This service refers to the endpoint that we want to reach and its definition its contained in the `servers.json` file.

The following is the `servers.json` file:

```json
{
    "sqrt": {                                   // This is the `Sqrt` used in the proto file
        "server_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000",  // Python server url
        "polling_config": {                     // Polling configuration
            "max_attempts": 30,
            "polling_interval": 2,
            "request_timeout": 60,
            "overall_timeout": 300
        }
    }
}
```

This file is how we interlink the protobuf service with the actual url of the server that we want to reach. The most common urls used will be:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for the python server as it will be always running in the same container as the cairo-hints agent.
- `https://agents-api-6nn4ryaqca-ew.a.run.app` for the agents-api that will run as a server in the cloud. This URL is for **DEVELOPMENT** purposes only.

When we define this server we must have in mind that the key used will be the endpoint that we want to call. Here we have `sqrt` as the key and the `server_url` is `http://127.0.0.1:8000` which in turn will make the request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sqrt`. This is important to have in mind as we have to define our endpoints in the server accordingly to the server key name.

### Generating the cairo files

Now we have all the configuration files needed to start using the `cairo-hints` utilities `scarb hints-generate`. This command will take the information declared in the `oracle.proto` file and the `servers.json` file and generate the `oracle.cairo` files to interact with the server.

```bash
scarb hints-generate
```

This will generate the `oracle.cairo` file in the `src` folder. This file will contain the structs and functions needed to interact with the server and it will also update the `Oracle.lock` file with the information of the last generation.

An example of the generated `oracle.cairo` file is the following:

```rust
use starknet::testing::cheatcode;
#[derive(Drop, Serde)]
struct Request {
    n: u64,
}
#[derive(Drop, Serde)]
struct Response {
    n: u64,
    status: ByteArray,
}

#[generate_trait]
impl SqrtOracle of SqrtOracleTrait {
    fn sqrt(arg: super::oracle::Request) -> super::oracle::Response {
        let mut serialized = ArrayTrait::new();
        arg.serialize(ref serialized);
        let mut result = cheatcode::<'sqrt'>(serialized.span());
        Serde::deserialize(ref result).unwrap()
    }
}
```

And it can be used in the `lib.cairo` file as follows:

```rust
// Add oracle as a module
mod oracle;

// Use the oracle module and import the service and request
use oracle::{Request, SqrtOracle};

fn main() -> bool {
    let num = 1764;

    // Fill the request struct
    let request = Request { n: num };

    // Call the oracle and it should return the struct used in the response definition
    let result = SqrtOracle::sqrt(request);

    result.n * result.n == num
}
```

### How to run

As we use the python server first we need to install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
```

Then we can run the server:

```bash
uvicorn python/src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --reload
# or
python python/src/main.py
```

And finally we can run the cairo program with `scarb hints-run --layout all_cairo`:

```bash
scarb hints-run --layout all_cairo
```

This will compile and run the program, using cairo hints to perform the square root of the number `1764` in the python server and check if the result is correct in cairo.

## Real world example using the agents-api

When we want to use the `agents-api` we need to perform some operations:

- Create a smart account
- Create a backend wallet
- Create a session key

### Pre-requisites with frontend

To make this process a little easier there is a frontend available to help us with this thre steps. You can find the frontend [here](https://github.com/gizatechxyz/agents-api/tree/develop/apps/demo-web)

You will need `node`, `nvm` and `npm` to run the frontend. You can install them with the following commands:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
```

Then you can clone the repository and run the frontend:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gizatechxyz/agents-api.git
cd agents-api/apps/demo-web
```

Create a `.env` with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID="abe0c73224ebc08133fa6c6a67681736"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="https://agents-api-6nn4ryaqca-ew.a.run.app"
```

Then run and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend in `http://localhost:3000` and you can follow the steps to create the smart account. For now only `thirdweb` is supported as there are somethings to improve in starknet.

In order to change the information used to create the session keys, there is a file for the constants at `agents-api/apps/demo-web/src/constants/index.ts`

Here you can import the chain that you want to use ([available list here](https://thirdweb.com/chainlist)) and can easily be imported in the `constants/index.ts` file.

```typescript
import { baseSepolia, zkSyncSepolia, zkSync, sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";
```

Then we need to fill the rest of the information that we need:

```typescript
// Select the chain here
export const chain = baseSepolia;

// Fill with the contract addresses you want to use
export const contractAddresses = ["0x638263e3eaa3917a53630e61b1fba685308024fa"];
// Fill with the functions you want to use
export const contractFunctions = ["claim"];
// Agent ID make sure to change it so it does not overwrite one from a colleague
export const agentId = "test";
```


If you want to use the `Send Test Transaction` button you will need to modify the function `handleSendTransaction` at `agents-api/apps/demo-web/src/thirdweb/page.tsx` with the calldata.

### How to add the Agents API to the server

To add the agents-api to the server we need to add the following to the `servers.json` file:

```json
{
    "sqrt": {
        "server_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
        "polling_config": {
            "max_attempts": 30,
            "polling_interval": 2,
            "request_timeout": 60,
            "overall_timeout": 300
        }
    },
    "execute": {
        "server_url": "http://127.0.0.1:3001/thirdweb/sessions/0xe2e2C18CC8f3Ba72013AaB13244f740f0f320B37",
        "polling_config": {
            "max_attempts": 30,
            "polling_interval": 2,
            "request_timeout": 60,
            "overall_timeout": 300
        }
    }
}
```

This will include the execute endpoint (have in mind that the actual endpoint is `server_url` + `/execute`). This endpoint will be used to interact with the agents-api and it will be used to execute the transaction using the session keys.

Now lets create the proto. The previous endpoint expects a request with the following structure:

```json
{
    "entrypoint": "{function to execute}",
    "agent_id": "{agent id, same as in the constants file}",
    "calldata": {
        // arbitrary calldata in form of a json of strings
    }
}
```

We can create the following proto struct for the request:

```proto
message ExecuteAPI {
    string entrypoint = 1;
    string agentId = 2;
    CallData calldata = 3;
}
```

As the call data is arbitrary we can create a new message for it:

```proto
message CallData {
    string receiver = 1;
    string tokenId = 2;
    string quantity = 3;
    string currency = 4;
    string pricePerToken = 5;
    AllowlistProof allowlistProof = 6;
    string data = 7;
}
```

And the `AllowlistProof` message is as follows:

```proto
message AllowlistProof {
    repeated string proof = 1;
    string quantityLimitPerWallet = 2;
    string pricePerToken = 3;
    string currency = 4;
}
```

As you can see you can nest message, as the `AllowlistProof` is a tuple in the smart contract we need to nest it into the call data.

The naming is important, proto follows the camelCase naming convention and the struct in cairo follows the snake_case naming convention, so when running `scarb hints-generate` the names will be converted from camelCase to snake_case. Later the call to the contract will be handled by the `execute` endpoint in the agents-api.

Now lets add the service to the `oracle.proto` file:

```proto
service Execute {
    rpc Execute(ExecuteAPI) returns (AgentsAPIResponse);
}
```

Now we are ready to run `scarb hints-generate` and generate the `oracle.cairo` file with our new structs.

Now we are ready to modify the `lib.cairo` file to include the new service:

```rust
mod oracle;

use oracle::{AllowlistProof, CallData, Execute, ExecuteApi};

fn main() -> bool {

    // Here we fill the call data of the contract
    let data = CallData {
                receiver: "0xe2e2C18CC8f3Ba72013AaB13244f740f0f320B37",
                token_id: "0",
                quantity: "1",
                currency: "0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",
                price_per_token: "0",
                // This is the allowlist proof nested in the call data
                allowlist_proof: Option::Some(AllowlistProof {
                        proof: array![],
                        quantity_limit_per_wallet: "0",
                        price_per_token: "115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935",
                        currency: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
                    }
                ),
                data: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080",
        };

    // Here we fill the request struct
    let request = ExecuteApi {
        entrypoint: "claim",
        agent_id: "test",
        calldata: Option::Some(data)
    };

    // Here we call the execute endpoint
    let agent_r = Execute::execute(request);

    true

}
```

Now we can run the cairo program with `scarb hints-run --layout all_cairo` and it will execute the transaction in the agents-api.

```bash
scarb hints-run --layout all_cairo
```

### Adding a preprocessing step

If we want to add a preprocessing step to the server we can do it by adding a new endpoint to the server and modifying the `main.py` file. This preprocessing step will be executed before the actual call to the cairo code. This is useful if we need to do some computation like gathering data, transforming data or get information from the database prior to passing it to cairo.

The following is an example of the `main.py` file with the preprocessing step:

```python
@app.post("/preprocess")
async def pre(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    print(f"Preprocessing data: {data}")
    return {"args": ""}
```

This will create a new endpoint `/preprocess` that will receive the data from the request and will print it to the console. This is useful to see the data that is being passed to the server.

Here we do the following:

- We create a new endpoint `/preprocess` that will receive the data from the request.
- Get the json data from the response.
- Execute the preprocessing step.
- Return the result as the arguments that will be passed to the cairo code. The arguments are passed as a single string reflecting the arguments that will be passed to the cairo code.

Then this args will be passed to the main function in the `lib.cairo` file.

This a way to test this is directly using the `hints-run` command:

```bash
scarb hints-run --no-build --args "some_value"
```

### Bringing it all together with Orion Runner

Orion Runner is our main entrypoint to the agent, this means that the call will be directed to the Orion Runner service, execute the preprocessing step and execute cairo using the hints. This is how the agent is going to be used in the real world.

For simplicity we provide a docker image of the orion runner that can be easily used to run the agent. The docker image is available in the `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/giza-platform-common/platform-images/orion-runner` repository.

To run the docker image first we need to create the `repository` where the needed files should be stored. This repository folder looks like this:

```
repository/
├── graph.onnx // Optional. Only if using ONNX.
└── programs
    ├── program1.sierra.json
    └── program2.sierra.json
├── Oracle.lock // Optional. Only for hints.
├── servers.json // Optional. Only for hints. 
```

As we will be using docker, we will need to tell the docker container where to call the python server that its running locally, for this we need to update  the `servers.json`:

```json
{
    "sqrt": {
        "server_url": "http://host.docker.internal:3000",
        "polling_config": {
            "max_attempts": 30,
            "polling_interval": 2,
            "request_timeout": 60,
            "overall_timeout": 300
        }
    }
}

Then we can run the docker image with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080  \
  -e REGISTRY_URL="file:///app/registry" \
  -e PREPROCESS_URL="http://host.docker.internal:3000/preprocess" \ # Here we suppose that your python server is running locally
  -v /your/path/to/registry:/app/registry \
  orion-runner
```

When the image is running we can do the E2E test with the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/agent_run \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"preprocess":true, "preprocess_body":{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}}'
```

The `preprocess` key is used to tell the Orion Runner to execute the preprocessing step and the `preprocess_body` is the data that will be passed to the server. The body can be any json that the preprocessing expects.
